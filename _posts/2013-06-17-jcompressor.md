Compressed script files are essential components to a website with high performance. This is extremely true for single-page web apps that strongly rely on a bunch of js files.

I wrote **jcompressor**, a node package that is capable of compressing all .js files in a folder. With just several hits you can build all .js files in minimal size for production environment at ease. Check out **jcompressor** on GitHub: [jcompressor](https://github.com/lichgo/jcompressor).
